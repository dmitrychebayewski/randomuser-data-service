# randomuser-demo
Spring Boot REST consumer application written in Kotlin.
The app is potential microservice built using Spring Boot (v.2.2.4).
The app is consuming the [Random User](https://randomuser.me/) REST web service,
and it is providing the data that could be useful for on-boarding process testing.
I aim on Docker and Integration testing part of the exercise.

## Software Stack
* Java JDK 8+/Kotlin as main execution environment
* Gradle 6
* Swagger 2
* Cucumber 5
* Docker is potentially supported if you intend trying out the demo on Mac / Linux 
## Setup
You need to have Java 8 SDK set up.
## IDE
This project was created in IntelliJ Community edition.

## Analysing The Solution
One can find the definition of features written in given-when-then Gherkin language at:
```
src/test/resources/randomuser-integration.feature
```
In order to navigate from .feature files to steps definitions code,
[Cucumber For Java](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?search=Cucumber) IDE plugin should be installed.

## Running Tests
This project uses [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).
Use one the following command to run the integration tests:
```
$./gradlew cucumber 
```
or
```
>.\gradlew.bat cucumber
```
## Starting the Application
Use one the following commands to start the application listening on your requests at port 8080.
```
$./gradlew bootRun 
```
or
``` 
>.\gradlew.bat bootRun
```
And open the link in browser to see the randomly generated user data.
http://localhost:8080/randomuser

## Swagger API
Open this link in browser to read the API 
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```
## Docker
Docker part is not supported on Windows.
The following approach is recommended if you're using Spring Boot v. 2.2.4:
* Build Spring boot application jar;
* Unzip the jar. This is beneficial
   if the application dependencies donâ€™t change, so the build will be faster, and so will the startup of the container at runtime,
    as long as the base layers are already cached;
* Build docker image;
* Run docker image.
The docker file has been provided to build the image and wrap the Spring Boot app.
To build the boot jar, use the following command:
```
$./gradlew bootJar
```
To unpack the jar, use the following command:
```
$cd build/libs/ && unzip *.jar 
$cd ../..
```
To build the Docker image and run it, use the following commands:
```
$docker build -t com.minskrotterdam/randomuser . 
$docker run -p 8080:8080 com.minskrotterdam/randomuser --server.port=8080
```
